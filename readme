This is a README file for Soccer-Analytics.

If attempting to run the jupyter notebook and you do not already have the database in the project folder, download from here:
https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer (scroll down to the data portion of the page and click download, then save to the same folder the jupyter notebook is in)

The directory contains:
- this readme
- database.sqlite
    - a sqlite database that contains 7 tables from the Kaggle database
    - this is all the data used in the project
- Soccer-Analytics.ipynb
    - a Jupyter notebook with code that cleans the data, selects features, and implements models
    - this is all the analysis in the project

There are about 325 lines of code in my project.

Code not written by me:

The functions get_previous_matches() and get_goals_in_prev_matches() are both modified from code written by u/airback.
These helper functions proved to be the most efficient ways of getting the data I needed, in the format I needed it in, to build my models.
